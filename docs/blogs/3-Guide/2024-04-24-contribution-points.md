## ArithFi Contribution Points


### What is ArithFi Contribution Points?

The Contribution Points reflect the user's level of contribution to ArithFi since its launch. Users with higher levels of contribution will receive greater airdrops from ArithFiDAO.

### How to calculate your contribution points?

---------------------------  

_**Your Contribution Points = Deposit Points + Invitation Points + Trading Points + Activity Points**_


---------------------------  

### Rules of Points

**1. Deposit Points**
  
- Deposit Points = Amount of ATF Deposited * Number of Days Held * 0.3%**

- Amount of ATF Deposited = Deposited ATF - Withdrawed ATF

> Example:
Tom deposits 10,000 ATF on January 1, 2024, and withdraws 1,000 ATF on January 10, 2024. His deposit points calculation until January 30, 2024, would be:
> 
> Deposit Points = (10,000 * 10 * 0.3%) + ((10,000 - 1,000) * 20 * 0.3%) = 840

**2. Invitation Points**
  
- Invitation Points = 10% of the deposit points of the invited person.

**3. Trading Points**

- Trading Points = Total Trading Volume / 100,000

**4. Activity Points:**

Points are awarded for following on ArithFi social platforms:
- ArithFi Twitter: 20 points
- ArithFi Telegram: 20 points
- ArithFi Discord: 20 points

Each action is awarded fixed points as listed.

### Time of Points

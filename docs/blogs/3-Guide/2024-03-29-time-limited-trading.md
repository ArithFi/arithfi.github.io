# ArithFi Time-Limited Trading

## What is time-limited trading?

Time-limited trading is an independent trading account introduced by ArithFi that allows users to trade airdrops within **72 hours** and receive profits as rewards. All margin for time-limited trading comes from airdrops by ArithFiDAO. If users trade and get profits in the time-limited account, these profits will convert into withdrawable real money after the time limit expires.

## Rules for time-limited trading
1. Within the initial **72 hours** of receiving the time-limited trading airdrop, you have the opportunity to trade and make profit.
2. If after **72 hours**, there are still open orders in your time-limited trading account, the system will automatically close them based on the prevailing market price.
3. After **72 hours**:
   - If you have profits in the time-limited tradign account, all profits in your time-limited trading account will automatically transfer to your regular trading account, becoming withdrawable real money.
   - The balance in your time-limited trading account will automatically reset to zero.

E.g. You receive a Time-Limited airdrop of 200 ATF. After a few transactions, your account balance becomes 500 ATF. Then, after 72 hours, your Main Account will automatically receive 300 ATF, and the Time-Limited account will be reset to zero.

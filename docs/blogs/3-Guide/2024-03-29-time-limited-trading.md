# ArithFi Time-Limited Trading

## What is time-limited trading?

Time-limited trading is an independent trading account introduced by ArithFi that allows users to complete trading tasks within 24 hours and receive rewards. All margin for time-limited trading comes from airdrops by ArithFiDAO. If users can fulfill the corresponding trading tasks, these airdrops will convert into withdrawable real money after the time limit expires.

## Rules for time-limited trading
1. Within the initial 24 hours of receiving the time-limited trading airdrop, you have the opportunity to complete **trading tasks**.
2. If after 24 hours, there are still open orders in your time-limited trading account, the system will automatically close them based on the prevailing market price.
3. After 24 hours:
   - If you complete the **trading tasks**, all margin in your time-limited trading account will automatically transfer to your regular trading account, becoming withdrawable real money.
   - If you fail to complete the **trading tasks**, all margin in your time-limited trading account will automatically reset to zero.

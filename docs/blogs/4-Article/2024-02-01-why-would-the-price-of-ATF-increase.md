In the wave of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), ArithFi, with its ATF token, is becoming a significant focus in the market. The ATF token is not just a medium of exchange; its design and economic model hint at a potential path for price increase, akin to a spiral staircase, gradually ascending. This article will analyze the main factors for the rise in value of the ATF token and discuss why it is considered an asset with robust growth potential.

#### What is ATF Token

In the world of digital currency, the role of the ATF token in the ArithFi protocol is undoubtedly revolutionary for future trading. In traditional trading, stablecoins like USDT are often used as collateral, but ArithFi breaks the norm by placing its native token, ATF, at the core. This trading model not only highlights the uniqueness of ATF but also provides users with a zero-transaction-fee and zero-price-slippage trading environment, while users can also benefit from the value growth of ATF.

#### From Governance Tokens to Securities to Native Assets, the Level of Demand Is Rising

From a broader perspective, the world of digital currency is witnessing an interesting shift: the role and value of tokens are constantly evolving. For example, Uniswap’s UNI token mainly plays a governance role, with demand coming from users who want to participate in platform governance. In contrast, Binance’s BNB, through corporate income repurchase and burn mechanisms, ties its value closely to platform performance, showing that the demand for security-like tokens such as BNB is significantly higher compared to governance tokens.

ArithFi’s ATF token is neither a pure governance token nor a typical security token. Its demand comes from the necessity of using ArithFi’s trading services, similar to how operations on the Ethereum network require ETH. This service-based demand level far exceeds the investment demand of a single enterprise or governance participation demand.

The continuous development of the ArithFi platform is undoubtedly a strong force driving the growth of ATF demand. As the platform introduces more asset types such as forex, precious metals, stock indices, and develops new products like vanilla options and structured products, ArithFi not only enhances the attractiveness of its services but also provides a solid foundation for the growth in demand for ATF tokens. The horizontal and vertical expansion of the platform not only improves user experience but, more importantly, these expansion strategies create a stable and continuously growing demand environment for ATF tokens.

#### Losses Are Long-term Investments in the Community, ATF Token Supply Is Deflationary

From a supply perspective, the total supply of ATF is 1 billion tokens, with 50% of ATF tokens locked in smart contracts for settlement in ArithFi trading services. Based on the SCP model (Smart Contract Counterparty Model) design, we have created a unique economic environment where traders’ losses are seen as long-term investments in the community. Since these tokens are locked, they inject more stability into ArithFi’s ecosystem. In terms of trading, the side with more chips will have an advantage in the trade, and ArithFi’s smart contract, acting as the counterparty, will be the advantaged side, leading to more and more ATF tokens being locked, thus continuously decreasing the supply of ATF in the long term.

Meanwhile, with the continuous growth or stability of ATF token demand, the change in the supply-demand relationship will inevitably drive the price of ATF tokens up. Therefore, considering the continuous decrease in supply and the potential increase in demand, it is foreseeable that the value of ATF tokens will trend upwards.

#### Short-term Token Outflows Will Not Cause a Price Death Spiral

In ArithFi’s economic system, the fluctuation in the value of ATF tokens is a natural market phenomenon, reflecting market participants’ expectations for the future and the current market conditions. When some users gain excessive trading profits, some may choose to sell ATF tokens, which could lead to some users’ capital outflows exceeding inflows in the short term, causing the price of ATF to drop. However, just like other cryptocurrencies such as ETH, whether users choose to sell depends on their confidence in the future price of ATF and their willingness to continue using the ArithFi platform. This price drop will not form a death spiral; on the contrary, as ArithFi’s trading services become richer and more users use ArithFi services, the low points of ArithFi’s price will be raised again and again. When users observe the spiral upward trend of ATF tokens, it will build more firm confidence in the long-term rise of the token, creating a ratchet effect where it is easier for the token price to rise than to fall.

#### Risk Management Measures Are Adopted to Balance Systemic Risks

It is reported that ArithFi will set up a stabilization fund at the beginning of the project to keep ATF price fluctuations stable through market intervention in the event of extreme market volatility. As the market capitalization grows and token holders become more distributed, the trades within ArithFi will become more balanced, and the rebound force when the price falls will also strengthen.

Combining the above factors, the ATF token shows strong growth potential. Its economic model, combined with demand growth, business expansion, market dynamics, and system design, collectively builds a stable upward price spiral. Although all investments come with risks, in the case of the ATF token, its intrinsic economic mechanisms provide a logically coherent and credible argument for growth.

ArithFi, with its unique token economics and smart contract architecture, showcases the innovative potential in the DeFi field. For investors looking to participate in the future of decentralized finance, the ATF token may represent an unmissable opportunity. As the platform continues to develop and expand, the price spiral of the ATF token is expected to continue on its upward trajectory, becoming a digital asset worth paying attention to. We welcome discussions and questions.

# The Gospel for Day Traders: A Treasure Exchange with No Slippage and No Fees

Are you a day trader? Do you want to execute bold trading strategies but feel constrained by fees and slippage? Let me introduce you to a recently discovered treasure exchange—**ArithFi**, where its zero fees and zero slippage feature will set your trades free.

Zero fees and zero slippage are a godsend for someone who likes day trading like me. It allows me to execute trading strategies I previously couldn't imagine without any pressure. For example, if I make ten trades in a minute, which is common for day traders like myself, I would incur at least $50 in fees on Binance for the same number of trades. At ArithFi, this number is zero. This means, while on Binance I would need to achieve over a 50% cumulative return rate to profit, at ArithFi, any positive cumulative return rate would make me money. This kind of free trading experience is unmatched by any other exchange.

Moreover, the absence of market makers at ArithFi means my trading positions aren’t targeted. Before major market movements, I can use 100x leverage to open both long and short positions simultaneously in a tiered margin system. As long as the cryptocurrency’s volatility exceeds 1%, I can profit steadily, a strategy that's suitable before major news releases and unfeasible on conventional exchanges where even small positions can lead to liquidation by market makers who aim to take your capital. ArithFi, without market makers and using oracle-based pricing, effectively avoids such pinning incidents. Additionally, the absence of fees significantly increases the probability of profit.

Furthermore, by leveraging ArithFi's no fees feature and real-time funding rate settlement, I can effortlessly arbitrage funding rates from centralized exchanges. I simply find pairs with high funding rates on centralized exchanges, ensuring the rates are more than twice the trading fees. Then, just before funding rate settlement (e.g., one minute), if the rate is positive, I open a short position on the centralized exchange and an equivalent long position on ArithFi. This ensures that regardless of market volatility, my positions are hedged overall. Finally, I close the positions on both exchanges after the funding rate settles. Ideally, with a funding rate of 0.1% and trading fees of 0.02% at 50x leverage, I could theoretically achieve a 1.5% return every eight hours.

ArithFi is truly a paradise for day traders, and being in its early stages, it has already attracted many users. Its token has significant potential for growth. The project is deeply incubated by the NEST Protocol, ensuring credibility. This is a major innovation in the DeFi space, and I believe ArithFi will soon be discovered by many more. If you want to earn 10x to 100x returns in this bull market, don't miss this opportunity to experience the allure of ArithFi first-hand!

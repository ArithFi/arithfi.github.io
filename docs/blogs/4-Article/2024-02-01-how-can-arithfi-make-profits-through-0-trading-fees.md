Many users are asking how ArithFi, with its offering of zero fees and zero slippage in futures trading, manages to make
profits? The answer is that ArithFi does not need to make profits.

ArithFi operates on a currency model, not a corporate model. Unlike traditional companies, it does not seek to maximize
shareholder benefits. Instead, it generates value by providing trading services and leveraging its unique token economy
model.

ArithFi aims to develop its ATF token into the third class of assets after BTC and ETH by providing derivatives trading
services. Therefore, the core of ArithFi is to give value to the ATF token, rather than generating fixed profits.

Here are the sources of value for the ATF token:

1. **Utility generated from trading services as a source of value**
   
   ArithFi offers users a trading experience with significantly lower costs compared to other exchanges, which is the
   core advantage of its trading services. The efficiency, security, and convenience experienced by users when trading
   futures, options, and other derivatives on the platform constitute the core value of ArithFi.

2. **Traders' accumulated losses converted into token burns**
   
   Statistics show that most individual investors typically struggle to beat the market. In ArithFi's economic model,
   this phenomenon is cleverly turned into part of the token's value. When traders incur losses, these $ATF tokens are
   sent to a smart contract and "burned." This burning mechanism reduces the total supply of tokens, theoretically
   increasing the scarcity and value of the remaining tokens, bringing potential profits to the platform and token
   holders.

3. **Cost efficiency and decentralization advantages**
   
   As ArithFi is not a profit-oriented corporate model but a currency model aimed at providing low-cost services, its
   operational costs are expected to become negligible as the platform becomes fully decentralized through the use of
   layer2 technology. Decentralization not only means lower operational costs but also more secure settlement services
   and broader market participation. In this way, the services provided by ArithFi will have a cost advantage in the
   market, generating sustained demand for the project.

In summary, ArithFi combines efficient trading services, a smart contract token burning mechanism, and low-cost
decentralized operations. These factors collectively ensure that ArithFi maintains sustainable competitiveness in the
fiercely competitive fintech industry while providing valuable services to users. As decentralized finance continues to
evolve, ArithFi presents a new economic model that could have a profound impact on the entire industry.

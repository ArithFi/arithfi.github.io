We are pleased to announce that ArithFi's accounting system has undergone restructuring and upgrading. To provide more flexible and efficient trading services, we have split the previous single account system into two parts: a futures account and a copy trading account. The following are the specifics of the adjustment:

### Before

1. Deposit types are not differentiated.
2. Account overall statistics
3. In the “My Traders” feature, only “Profit” indicates the total PnL.

### After

1. Deposit types: Deposit, Commission, Profit Sharing, Return, Copy Settlement.
2. The account is divided into an overview account, a futures account, and a copy trading account.
3. Profit is divided into Profit&Loss and Unrealized PnL.

Please note that the data for the two accounts will be produced after the upgrade. The above adjustments will be completed before 12:00 UTC on November 10, 2023, and standard transactions will not be affected during the upgrade.

We sincerely appreciate your ongoing support and trust in ArithFi. We will continue to strive to provide you with better trading experiences and services. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions or require assistance.
